# Analysis-of-variance
R ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) done upon precipitation data comparing Buffalo and San Diego. ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, Median Tests, Levene and Kolmogorov-Smirnov diagnostic tests are completed to determine significant evidence of climate change from 1940 to 2025.

Title: Geo411/Analysis-of-Variance
Overview: Using ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, and Median tests precipitation data from Buffalo and San Diego from 1940 to 2025 are compared to point towards climate change over an 85 year period.
Methods: ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, and Median tests. Box plots, normalcy graphs, and histograms are also used to visualize the data to look for factors such as homoskedacity. Preliminary descriptive statistics are also done upon the data to help make variables to analyze the data to complete multivariate data.
Key findings: Both ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests found significant evidence that the population means of precipitation amongst three different time periods of the Buffalo data are not all equal. Both ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests found significant evidence that the population means of precipitation amongst three different time periods of the San Diego data are not all equal. However, the median tests did not find significant evidence for either city that the medians are meaningfully different from each other.
Tools: ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, Median tests, Levene and Kolmogorov-Smirnov, descriptive statistics, box plots, and histograms
Reflection: While there is evidence that Buffalo has had some change in precipitation, due to the nature of ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests, it cannot determined which population mean is different, and whether this is a positive or negative anomoly.
